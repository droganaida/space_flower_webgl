# Space Flower: An Interactive Shader Effect | WebGL + Three.js
Space Flower is an interactive graphic demonstration utilizing WebGL and Three.js.
This project showcases the application of GLSL shaders and particle visualization to create a beautiful and captivating visual experience.
Users can interact with the visualization through mouse scrolling and a customizable interface, allowing for changes in colors, particle size, noise intensity, and animation speed.
